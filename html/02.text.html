        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language 
        for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local 
        storage and render them into multimedia web pages. 
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
        included cues for the appearance of the document.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, 
        may be embedded into the rendered page. 
        It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
        semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and 
        other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
